# digital-stopwatch

Simple HTML, CSS, and JS digital stopwatch

The stopwatch is in the style of a digital clock that displays the time count up in milliseconds, seconds, minutes, and hours. It can be started and stopped with the green start button which then becomes a red stop button.

<br>

The yellow split button may be used to preserve an interval of time between the start of the stopwatch and the use of the split button (when split is first used) or between split usages (every time after).

<br>

The black reset button is used to reset the time back to its base value and remove all recorded time intervals.

<br>

The clear button on the list of interval can be used to clear all intervals.

<br>

The clipboard button is used to copy a particular point in time on the stopwatch in the format "HH:MM:SS.MSS". A message is displayed momentarily when the time is copied.
